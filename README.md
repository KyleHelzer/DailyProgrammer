Practice problems from www.reddit.com/r/DailyProgrammer. 

This is where I am storing my work for the problems posed on the subreddit /r/DailyProgrammer on reddit.com

Many are written in Python 2.7.8 and the filenames stand for "Daily Programmer Easy/Intermediate/Hard" follow by the project number.'\n'
Thus  DPE215.py would be Easy challenge #215'\n'
      DPI215.py would be Intermediate challenge #215'\n'
      DPH215.py would be Hard challenge #215'\n'
